when you have list of words, add a space in front of each word unless it is punctuation or the first word (do the first word and then do the rest in a loop starting at 1). also put each into a span based on its part of speech and then add class for main verb and main subject. 


for random color schemes, use root and variables and then link to random css sheet with just the color schemes (use main css for everything else). 


todo:

begin button and enter function:
    label the root
    label the noun

Root & Sub button:
    get rid of backgorund of all other words
    fade all other words
